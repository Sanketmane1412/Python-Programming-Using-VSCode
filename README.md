# Python-Programming-Using-VSCode

I learned Python programming from the basics to key concepts, focusing heavily on logic building and problem-solving. I started with Python fundamentals, covering syntax, variables, data types, and basic input-output operations. I practiced conditional statements for decision-making and used for loops and while loops for repetitive tasks.

I gained hands-on experience with Python data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. I learned how to carry out common operations on these structures. I also worked on string operations for text manipulation and managing data. Understanding functions allowed me to write reusable and modular code, which made it easier to read and more efficient.

I grasped the use of pass statements and basic divisibility logic. I implemented various practice programs to strengthen my fundamentals. Additionally, I learned how to read from and write data into files.

Overall, this learning helped me build a solid foundation in Python. I can apply this knowledge in data analysis, automation, backend logic, and machine learning projects in the future.
